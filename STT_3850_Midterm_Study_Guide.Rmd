#Statistics
###Characterizing a set of data (3 Sâ€™s)
  * Shape: how the data is distributed
  * Low outliers make a dataset skewed to the Right
  * High outliers make a dataset skewed to the Left
  * Normal distributions have fairly even outliers on either side
  
###Center: Where the data is centered around
  * Normal: If the dataset has a normal distribution (shape) this can be calculated using the `mean($data)` function.
  * Skewed (left or right): The mean will be misrepresent the center. Calculate a skewed center using `median($data)`.

###Spread: How far the data differs from the center
  * Normal: If the dataset has a normal distribution, then the standard deviation applies to both sides of the data and so it represents the spread.
  * Skewed (left or right): If the dataset is skewed on either side, the deviation above and below the center will not be the same, so you must calculate it using `IQR($data)` for the interquartile range.

###Hypothesis testing (5 step procedure)
  1. Specify the Null and ALternative hypothesis
    + Null hypothesis notated as $H_0:M=value$ or $\bar{M_1}-\bar{M_2}=0$
    + Alternative hypothesis notated as $H_A:M\neq0$
