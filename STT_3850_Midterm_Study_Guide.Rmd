#Statistics
##Characterizing a set of data (3 Sâ€™s)
###Shape: how the data is distributed
####Low outliers make a dataset skewed to the Right
####High outliers make a dataset skewed to the Left
####Normal distributions have fairly even outliers on either side
###Center: Where the data is centered around
####Normal: If the dataset has a normal distribution (shape) this can be calculated using the `mean($data)` function.  
####Skewed (left or right): The mean will be misrepresent the center. Calculate a skewed center using `median($data)`.
####Spread: How far the data differs from the center
Normal: If the dataset has a normal distribution, then the standard deviation applies to both sides of the data and so it represents the spread.
Skewed (left or right): If the dataset is skewed on either side, the deviation above and below the center will not be the same, so you must calculate it using `IQR($data)` for the interquartile range.
